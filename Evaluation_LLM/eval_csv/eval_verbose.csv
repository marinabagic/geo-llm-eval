``` The provided response is a Python script using ArcPy for geospatial analysis within ArcGIS. It sets the workspace, defines the input forest shapefile, and performs several spatial operations such as buffering, clipping, and intersecting. The results are then saved to a new shapefile.

The operations performed can be adjusted based on specific analytical needs. ```","### Instruction:

### Response:
```plaintext
Language: JavaScript
Library: Google Earth Engine (GEE)
Dataset: WWF/HydroSHEDS/15ACC

Summary: 
This code calculates the Topographic Wetness Index (TWI) using the Flow Accumulation (facc) data from the WWF/HydroSHEDS/15ACC dataset. The TWI is computed by multiplying the flow accumulation with the nominal scale of the projection, dividing it by the product of slope and the tangent of the slope in radians, and then taking the natural logarithm of the result. The resulting TWI image is added to the map for visualization.

Spatial Range: Global (since the HydroSHEDS dataset covers global hydrological features)
Time Range: Not specified (the dataset does not have a specific temporal component)
